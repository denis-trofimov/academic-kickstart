### First, let‚Äôs start with areas of expertise you either have or would like to acquire. {.western}

<pre class="western">In the MSU university I had specialization in mechanics, the field combining mathematics and physics. 
Now I am making my living developing applications, working for the company Vsor Systems LLC in Moscow, Russia.
I am leading our small developing department that consists of 3 developers.

I am working on the software project for the our company's product, an eye iris identification system. This software uses machine learning convolutional neural networks for camera image analysis (computer vision) and runs on brand-new GPU.
In the year 2017 we have produced the working prototype of the software for the our company's first eye iris identification system. The software for both  an iris capture device and an iris recognition portal stand uses the custom Python Caffe CNN for camera image analysis and runs on ‚ÄúJetson TX1‚Äù Nvidia GPU. We have assembled the Python server back-end using a PostgreSQL DB and gRPC on top of Protobuf protocol. The control UI application we made using a Qt QML Controls 2.0 and a gRPC client-server bridge to our server.

Programming languages C, C++, Python.
Have developed applications using databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, Maria-DB(Mysql).
Had some PHP, JavaScript projects.
Doen stock traiding, futures and options trading.
A user of Linux debian, fedora, ubuntu,
Used virtualization like VMVare, Oracle Virtual PC or smth.
