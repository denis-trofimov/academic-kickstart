# Review of Kevlin Henney\`s talk Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers

_I watched this video from the start till the end._
_I see this coding habits very often._
_I fought unsustainable spacing the wrong way in the past._

# Kevlin Henney\`s talk video description

> Habits help you manage the code complexity. You apply existing skill and knowledge automatically to the detail while focusing on the bigger picture.
> 
> But because you acquire habits largely by imitation, and rarely question them, how do you know your habits are effective? Many of the habits that programmers have for naming, formatting, commenting and unit testing do not stand up as rational and practical on closer inspection. [Kevlin Henney][1] [@kevlinhenney][2] examines seven coding habits that are not as effective as programmers believe, and to suggest alternatives.

> Well I do code in life every day and in my team we discussed style a lot and (without having heard of him or his views) we agreed on similar conclusions as he does and it is as least better than what we did before at least.
> 
> If I copy code from another project (as a start because they solved a similar problem) and rewrite it in our style often just half or even a third of the code remains. That makes a lot of a difference.
> 
> So I think it&#8217;s absolutely doable, it just requires some effort and thought. There are sure other ways to do it well, as long as you really think about it and not just write code to &#8220;solve a problem&#8221;.

> On long lines: why my code must fit into s\***ty projector or console when most of the time most of the programmers don&#8217;t look at it this way. We had column screens long time ago, now have wide screens everywhere. Why don&#8217;t use its space? When you must show the code on projector &#8211; reformat it deliberately for the presentation and then throw away. I have more problems with unnecessary columned style, I just see less code.

> The point is that those things like &#8220;Manager&#8221;, &#8220;Observer&#8221;, etc. are usually added to denote a pattern that the class in question follows, they typically actually have a use and do make sense. If your class is a simply class that describes an object just name it after the object but if it&#8217;s something that uses objects and does something with them following design patterns then by all means i think you should add the pattern&#8217;s name in there so that it&#8217;s quickly searchable and recognisable
